#### The following project presents a detailed analysis of the performance of various movie recommendation models using the MovieLens 10M dataset.

##### **Linear Regression Model (Mean Baseline):**

##### * The average of the scores in the training set is calculated.
##### * Predictions are made using this average for the validation set.
##### * The model is evaluated using metrics such as MAE, MSE and RMSE.
##### * This approach establishes a baseline for comparing other more complex models.

##### **Linear Regression Model with Film Bias:**

##### * The bias is calculated for each movie in the training set.
##### * This bias is incorporated into a linear regression model to make predictions.
##### * The model is evaluated using the same evaluation metrics.

##### **Linear Regression Model with Movie and User Bias:**

##### * The bias is calculated for both movies and users in the training set.
##### * These biases are incorporated into a linear regression model to make predictions.
##### * The model is evaluated using the same evaluation metrics.

##### **Linear Regression Model with Regularized Bias:**

##### * The code begins by installing and loading the necessary libraries. It then defines three primary functions: compute_biases, predict_ratings, and evaluate_model. The compute_biases function calculates the average rating and biases for movies and users, returning these values in a list. The predict_ratings function uses these biases to predict ratings for the validation dataset. The evaluate_model function integrates these two functions, computing the biases and using them to predict ratings, ultimately calculating and returning the RMSE.

##### * In the main execution block, the structure and missing values of the training and validacion datasets are checked. A range of lambda values is defined, and for each lambda, the RMSE is calculated using the evaluate_model function. The lambda with the lowest RMSE is selected as the best lambda. Final biases are computed using this best lambda, and these biases are then used to predict ratings for the validation dataset. The model is evaluated by calculating MAE, MSE, and RMSE, and the results are printed.

##### * Overall, the code efficiently implements a regularization model by iteratively finding the best lambda, computing biases, predicting ratings, and evaluating the modelâ€™s performance.

##### **Factorization Matrix:**

##### * The training and test sets are converted into a format compatible with the factorization matrix.
##### * The factorization matrix is used to make predictions.
##### * The model is evaluated using the same evaluation metrics.

##### Each model is evaluated on both the validation set and the final test set (final_holdout_test). The evaluation results are compiled in a table that shows the MAE, MSE, and RMSE metrics for each model in both data sets. This approach allows the performance of different movie recommendation models to be compared in terms of predictive accuracy.

##### In conclusion the results show that more advanced models, such as those that incorporate both movie and user biases, along with regularization or matrix factorization, significantly outperform the simple baseline model that uses only the average of the ratings. These advanced models achieve significant reductions in Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) compared to the base model, indicating an improvement in recommendation accuracy. of movies. 

##### Furthermore, matrix factorization emerges as the most effective technique, with the lowest values of MAE, MSE, and RMSE in both data sets, suggesting that it more accurately captures the complex interactions between users and movies in the data set. MovieLens 10M.

##### In summary, the results suggest that more complex models, which consider both movie and user bias, along with regularization or matrix factorization, tend to provide better movie recommendation accuracy compared to a simple baseline approach.
